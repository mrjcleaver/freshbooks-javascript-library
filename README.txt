DESCRIPTION:

This is a Javascript library for FreshBooks API (http://developers.freshbooks.com/overview/). If you don't want to deal with XML directly this might be the tool for you.

Developer: Milan Rukavina, rukavinamilan@gmail.com

PORTED FROM http://code.google.com/p/freshbooks-javascript-library/ version 8 - Feb 26, 2010
INTO Github to encourage collaboration 

By: Martin Cleaver

======================================================================

NOTES:
- This library has not yet been adapted for nodejs
- A goal for moving this to github is to encourage collaboration for that goal
- Martin is in no position to judge whether this library is a reasonable starting point for that goal :)

======================================================================

REQUIREMENTS:

proxy.php or similar server side script as a proxy is required since at the moment is not possible to make cross-domain ajax calls - so it's not possible to communicate with freshbooks server from client side javascript. Other possible work arround could be with using flash component like http://flxhr.flensed.com/

======================================================================

USAGE:

Please take a look at example.htm file from this package. It's trivial an example but should be good enough to demonstrate the usage. For more details please reffer to docs directory.
